This is my first repo. 
cd - change directory --> changing folders
ls- list - shows what is in folder
pwd - point working directory - shows you what folder you're in 
mkdir - make directory - make folders
nano - creates file and opens text editor 
git init - initialises git repository - you need init to use git
git add - adds new changes to working tree 
git commit - commit chnages for the new push 
git push - pushing changes to git hub repository
